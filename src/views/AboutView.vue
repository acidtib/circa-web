        <p>Sadly, the management of Circa Fitzsimons have a nasty little habit of deleting controversial posts from the community portal that residents use to share information or the countless horror stories of the non-stop crimes happening in our small community.</p>

        <p>This website was created after numerous incidents of information and criminal evidence going missing from the community portal. Its purpose is to maintain an independent archive of every post and reply.</p>
